//You are given an m x n binary matrix grid.
// An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.)
// You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

//The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.

//Return the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0.
